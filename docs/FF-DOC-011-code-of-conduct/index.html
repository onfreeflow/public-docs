<h1>FreeFlow Code of Conduct</h1>
<h2>Why We Exist</h2>
<p>At FreeFlow, we believe that infrastructure should be <strong>open</strong>, <strong>transparent</strong>, and <strong>built to serve</strong> â€” not just serve profits, but serve people, communities, and the planet.<br>
This isnâ€™t just about code or credits; itâ€™s about <strong>building something together</strong> that is bigger than any one of us.</p>
<p>We exist to push the boundaries of what EV networks, carbon programs, and open business models can achieve when guided by trust, collaboration, and responsibility.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Who This Code Applies To</h2>
<p>This Code applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.</li>
<li>Quality assurance, operations, support, and legal teams.</li>
<li>Sales, marketing, partnerships, and strategy professionals.</li>
<li>Contributors from the open-source community.</li>
<li>Installers, site hosts, subcontractors, and third-party integrators.</li>
<li>Anyone participating in or interacting with FreeFlow, whether employed, contracted, or contributing voluntarily.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Our Principles</h2>
<h3>1. We Lead with Purpose</h3>
<p>We donâ€™t just build to build â€” we build to solve. We believe in creating networks and businesses that reward <strong>doing the right thing</strong>, even when it's harder.</p>
<h3>2. We Respect Everyone</h3>
<p>Every role matters.<br>
Every contribution matters.<br>
Whether you wrote the first line of code, organized a project timeline, answered a customer ticket, or contributed a regulatory insight â€” you belong here.</p>
<p>We treat each other with dignity, empathy, and patience, especially across disciplines.</p>
<h3>3. We Honor Open Source Values</h3>
<p>FreeFlow is rooted in the power of open collaboration.<br>
We inherited, and honor, the obligations of the <strong>Reciprocal Public License (RPL-1.5)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements must be shared.</li>
<li>Attribution must be respected.</li>
<li>Communities must be enabled, not exploited.</li>
</ul>
<p>This applies equally to FreeFlowâ€™s open-source and open-business practices.</p>
<h3>4. We Build Trust</h3>
<p>Trust is fragile.<br>
We commit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open communication.</li>
<li>Transparent decision-making.</li>
<li>Publishing what we can, when we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you are reviewing code, working with a customer, or contributing a policy, your actions should build trust, internally and externally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Expectations of Everyone</h2>
<h3>ðŸŸ£ Be Curious</h3>
<p>Ask questions. Seek understanding.<br>
Whether youâ€™re an engineer learning about EVSE policy or a project manager learning about cryptography â€” curiosity is how we grow.</p>
<h3>ðŸŸ£ Be Considerate</h3>
<p>Your words, actions, and work affect others.<br>
Communicate thoughtfully, even under pressure.</p>
<h3>ðŸŸ£ Collaborate Openly</h3>
<p>We donâ€™t hoard knowledge.<br>
We share drafts, ideas, challenges, and successes early and often.</p>
<h3>ðŸŸ£ Value Diversity</h3>
<p>Different backgrounds and perspectives make us better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity of skills.</li>
<li>Diversity of disciplines.</li>
<li>Diversity of life experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>We celebrate and actively protect inclusivity.</p>
<h3>ðŸŸ£ Commit to Quality</h3>
<p>Whether it's code, documentation, business process, or outreach â€” we strive for excellence.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Anti-Harassment Commitment</h2>
<p>We do not tolerate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harassment of any kind.</li>
<li>Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any protected characteristic.</li>
<li>Aggressive, hostile, or demeaning behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone engaging in such behavior may be removed from the project, platform, or FreeFlow activities at FreeFlowâ€™s discretion.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Working Across Roles</h2>
<p>We recognize that our success is interdisciplinary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineers</strong> â†’ Simplify when you can. Make systems understandable and usable by people outside of engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Business &amp; Strategy</strong> â†’ Engage with technical contributors with patience and curiosity.</li>
<li><strong>Sales &amp; Partnerships</strong> â†’ Represent FreeFlow with honesty and humility.</li>
<li><strong>Project Managers</strong> â†’ Foster communication and realistic expectations across teams.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> â†’ Safeguard the reliability of everything we ship.</li>
<li><strong>Installers &amp; Contractors</strong> â†’ Act with professionalism and integrity as field representatives of our work.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Open Network + FreeFlow Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Remember that Open Network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must remain open and transparent.</li>
<li>Requires reciprocal licensing compliance.</li>
<li>Is the shared inheritance of everyone contributing.</li>
</ul>
<p>FreeFlow as a company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respects and upholds the spirit of open-source.</li>
<li>Commits to maintaining and improving Open Network responsibly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>We resolve disagreements through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respectful discussion.</li>
<li>Community input.</li>
<li>Maintainer or Steering Group guidance.</li>
<li>Formal mediation if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, kindness is required.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Violations of this Code may result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warnings.</li>
<li>Temporary suspension from participation.</li>
<li>Permanent exclusion from FreeFlow platforms, projects, or events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions will be made transparently whenever possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Note</h2>
<p>At FreeFlow, the question is not simply &quot;what are we building?&quot; â€”<br>
It is always <strong>&quot;why are we building this?&quot;</strong><br>
And the answer must always include <strong>people</strong>.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s build responsibly, together.</p>
