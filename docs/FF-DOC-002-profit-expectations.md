# FreeFlow Profit Expectations

## Overview

This document provides an illustrative view of FreeFlow's potential profit model based on:
- LCFS Credits
- Carbon Credits
- Driver Subscriptions
- Contributor Profit Sharing (LTY, STY, XP)

All figures below represent **total company profits** (green and non-green combined). Contributor earnings are calculated as a percentage of these totals through the FreeFlow Contributor Profit Sharing Framework.

## Reference Dataset

| Chargers | Carbon Credits (Non-Green) | Carbon Credits (Green) | Subscriptions | Total Profit (Low) | Total Profit (High) |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 60 | $3,943.64 | $15,774.57 | $6,480 | $10,423.64 | $22,254.57 |
| 1,000 | $65,727.38 | $262,909.50 | $108,000 | $173,727.38 | $370,909.50 |
| 2,500 | $164,318.44 | $657,273.75 | $270,000 | $434,318.44 | $927,273.75 |
| 5,000 | $328,636.88 | $1,314,547.50 | $540,000 | $868,636.88 | $1,854,547.50 |
| 7,000 | $460,091.63 | $1,840,366.50 | $756,000 | $1,216,091.63 | $2,596,366.50 |

## Contributor Profit Sharing Model

Each contributor receives a percentage of **total company profits** based on:
- **LTY (Long-Term Yield)** — Base percentage earned from XP.
- **STY (Short-Term Yield)** — Time-limited bonus percentage.
- **XP** — Reputation and contribution tracking.

### Example Scenario
A contributor with:
- **5% LTY**
- **2% STY** (active)
will have **7%** profit share during STY period and revert to **5%** afterward.

## Contributor Earnings Projection

| Chargers | Total Profit (Low) | Total Profit (High) | Contributor @5% | Contributor @7% (With STY) |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| 60 | $10,423.64 | $22,254.57 | $521.18 - $1,112.73 | $729.66 - $1,558.38 |
| 1,000 | $173,727.38 | $370,909.50 | $8,686.37 - $18,545.47 | $12,160.92 - $25,963.67 |
| 2,500 | $434,318.44 | $927,273.75 | $21,715.92 - $46,363.69 | $30,402.29 - $64,909.16 |
| 5,000 | $868,636.88 | $1,854,547.50 | $43,431.84 - $92,727.38 | $60,804.59 - $130,318.33 |
| 7,000 | $1,216,091.63 | $2,596,366.50 | $60,804.58 - $129,818.32 | $85,126.41 - $181,745.65 |

## XP Holding Advantage

- XP can be converted into STY within **4 years** of earning.
- Contributors may strategically delay conversion to benefit from future FreeFlow growth.
- Example:
   - Contributor earns XP in Year 1.
   - Delays conversion until Year 4.
   - Accesses STY when the network may have 5,000+ chargers and significantly higher total profit.

This mechanic aligns contributors with long-term network success.
