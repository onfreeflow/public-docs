## FreeFlow Network Operator Role

Internationally, FreeFlow offers:
- Open-source tools for LCFS or carbon data collection
- Optional aggregation services for entities seeking to claim or monetize credits
- Documentation for third-party adaptations to region-specific requirements

FreeFlow does not claim carbon credits internationally unless expressly contracted or designated as the Network Provider.

---

## Best Practices for International Forks
- Ensure proper data collection and session recording as required by local authorities.
- Consider establishing FreeFlow as a **Credit Service Partner** if seeking aggregated reporting or compliance services.
- Forks may adapt FreeFlow software but must ensure legal compliance for credit programs independently unless formally partnered.

---

## Transparency & Reporting
FreeFlow encourages forks and users of its network to:
- Report credit claims transparently
- Comply with national registries or programs
- Engage with FreeFlow for knowledge-sharing and alignment
