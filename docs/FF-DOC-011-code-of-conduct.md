# FreeFlow Code of Conduct

## Why We Exist

At FreeFlow, we believe that infrastructure should be **open**, **transparent**, and **built to serve** â€” not just serve profits, but serve people, communities, and the planet.  
This isnâ€™t just about code or credits; itâ€™s about **building something together** that is bigger than any one of us.

We exist to push the boundaries of what EV networks, carbon programs, and open business models can achieve when guided by trust, collaboration, and responsibility.

## Who This Code Applies To

This Code applies to:
- Engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.
- Quality assurance, operations, support, and legal teams.
- Sales, marketing, partnerships, and strategy professionals.
- Contributors from the open-source community.
- Installers, site hosts, subcontractors, and third-party integrators.
- Anyone participating in or interacting with FreeFlow, whether employed, contracted, or contributing voluntarily.

## Our Principles

### 1. We Lead with Purpose
We donâ€™t just build to build â€” we build to solve. We believe in creating networks and businesses that reward **doing the right thing**, even when it's harder.

### 2. We Respect Everyone
Every role matters.  
Every contribution matters.  
Whether you wrote the first line of code, organized a project timeline, answered a customer ticket, or contributed a regulatory insight â€” you belong here.

We treat each other with dignity, empathy, and patience, especially across disciplines.

### 3. We Honor Open Source Values
FreeFlow is rooted in the power of open collaboration.  
We inherited, and honor, the obligations of the **Reciprocal Public License (RPL-1.5)**:
- Improvements must be shared.
- Attribution must be respected.
- Communities must be enabled, not exploited.

This applies equally to FreeFlowâ€™s open-source and open-business practices.

### 4. We Build Trust
Trust is fragile.  
We commit to:
- Open communication.
- Transparent decision-making.
- Publishing what we can, when we can.

Whether you are reviewing code, working with a customer, or contributing a policy, your actions should build trust, internally and externally.

## Expectations of Everyone

### ðŸŸ£ Be Curious
Ask questions. Seek understanding.  
Whether youâ€™re an engineer learning about EVSE policy or a project manager learning about cryptography â€” curiosity is how we grow.

### ðŸŸ£ Be Considerate
Your words, actions, and work affect others.  
Communicate thoughtfully, even under pressure.

### ðŸŸ£ Collaborate Openly
We donâ€™t hoard knowledge.  
We share drafts, ideas, challenges, and successes early and often.

### ðŸŸ£ Value Diversity
Different backgrounds and perspectives make us better.
- Diversity of skills.
- Diversity of disciplines.
- Diversity of life experience.

We celebrate and actively protect inclusivity.

### ðŸŸ£ Commit to Quality
Whether it's code, documentation, business process, or outreach â€” we strive for excellence.

## Anti-Harassment Commitment

We do not tolerate:
- Harassment of any kind.
- Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any protected characteristic.
- Aggressive, hostile, or demeaning behavior.

Anyone engaging in such behavior may be removed from the project, platform, or FreeFlow activities at FreeFlowâ€™s discretion.

## Working Across Roles

We recognize that our success is interdisciplinary.

- **Engineers** â†’ Simplify when you can. Make systems understandable and usable by people outside of engineering.
- **Business & Strategy** â†’ Engage with technical contributors with patience and curiosity.
- **Sales & Partnerships** â†’ Represent FreeFlow with honesty and humility.
- **Project Managers** â†’ Foster communication and realistic expectations across teams.
- **Quality Assurance** â†’ Safeguard the reliability of everything we ship.
- **Installers & Contractors** â†’ Act with professionalism and integrity as field representatives of our work.

## Open Network + FreeFlow Responsibilities

Remember that Open Network:
- Must remain open and transparent.
- Requires reciprocal licensing compliance.
- Is the shared inheritance of everyone contributing.

FreeFlow as a company:
- Respects and upholds the spirit of open-source.
- Commits to maintaining and improving Open Network responsibly.

---

## Conflict Resolution

We resolve disagreements through:
1. Respectful discussion.
2. Community input.
3. Maintainer or Steering Group guidance.
4. Formal mediation if needed.

In all cases, kindness is required.

---

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code may result in:
- Warnings.
- Temporary suspension from participation.
- Permanent exclusion from FreeFlow platforms, projects, or events.

Decisions will be made transparently whenever possible.

---

## Final Note

At FreeFlow, the question is not simply "what are we building?" â€”  
It is always **"why are we building this?"**  
And the answer must always include **people**.

Letâ€™s build responsibly, together.
