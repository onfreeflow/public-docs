<li>Optional aggregation services for entities seeking to claim or monetize credits</li>
<li>Documentation for third-party adaptations to region-specific requirements</li>

<h2>Best Practices for International Forks</h2>

<p>FreeFlow encourages forks and users of its network to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report credit claims transparently</li>
