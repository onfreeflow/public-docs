<h1>FreeFlow Business Plan</h1>
<h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>FreeFlow is an open-source network platform designed to revolutionize the deployment, management, and monetization of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) infrastructure. We enable contributors, site hosts, fleet operators, and businesses to participate in an open, profitable, and globally adaptable network that generates real-world value — both in terms of revenue and impact.</p>
<p>FreeFlow is more than software; it is an <strong>open business</strong>. Through LCFS credits, carbon credits, driver subscriptions, and contributor profit sharing, FreeFlow unlocks opportunities typically gated behind proprietary networks.</p>
<h2>2. Mission &amp; Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>: Create a transparent, open, and scalable EVSE network ecosystem that benefits contributors, operators, and communities.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: To make EV charging infrastructure free to deploy, verifiable, and directly profitable to those who build, operate, and improve it.</p>
<h2>3. Market Overview</h2>
<p>The EV infrastructure market is projected to grow aggressively over the next decade. Regional programs such as California’s LCFS and similar carbon credit systems globally are injecting billions into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, the market is dominated by closed networks. FreeFlow presents an alternative — an open-source platform capable of generating credits, serving fleets, supporting drivers, and rewarding contributors.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Business Model &amp; Monetization</h2>
<p>FreeFlow does not monetize charging itself. Instead, revenue flows through <strong>infrastructure services</strong> and <strong>green energy incentive programs</strong>.</p>
<p>Revenue sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LCFS Credits</strong> (California and similar programs)</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Credits</strong> (International)</li>
<li><strong>Driver Subscriptions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Basic (small fixed fee, removes payout fees)</li>
<li>Premium (removes all fees)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fleet Services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit Sharing Pool</strong> for contributors</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5. FreeFlow Ownership of Environmental Credits</h2>
<p>All LCFS, carbon credits, or similar green program incentives resulting from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charging events on the FreeFlow network,</li>
<li>Any fork, derivative, or imitation of the FreeFlow network,</li>
<li>Any deployment using FreeFlow-generated software or services,</li>
</ul>
<p>are the exclusive property of <strong>FreeFlow</strong>.</p>
<p>This ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with CARB and other regulators.</li>
<li>A clear, open-source-compatible funding mechanism.</li>
<li>The financial sustainability of FreeFlow and its contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forks or independent operators may only claim credits via <strong>formal agreements</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Contributor Profit Sharing Framework</h2>
<h3>Profit Distribution</h3>
<p>FreeFlow allocates <strong>up to 30%</strong> of total annual profits into the Contributor Profit Pool, divided as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-Term Yield (LTY)</strong> — Reserved for contributions with ongoing impact.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Term Yield (STY)</strong> — For discrete, recent contributions.</li>
<li><strong>XP</strong> — Contributor reputation points, convertible into STY within 4 years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributor Roles Eligible</h3>
<ul>
<li>Engineers</li>
<li>Designers</li>
<li>Business Analysts</li>
<li>Quality Assurance</li>
<li>Sales &amp; Strategy</li>
<li>Project Management</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Community &amp; Ecosystem Builders</li>
</ul>
<h3>XP Conversion Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
<li>XP can be converted into STY at any point up to 4 years after earning.</li>
<li>Holding XP may yield higher STY if FreeFlow becomes more profitable over time.</li>
<li>This encourages long-term alignment between contributors and FreeFlow's success.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>7. Technology Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Built upon the Open Network under the RPL license.</li>
<li>FreeFlow adds:
<ul>
<li>Contributor governance.</li>
<li>Secure LCFS and carbon credit reporting.</li>
<li>Network-level profit-sharing mechanisms.</li>
<li>Fleet management tools.</li>
<li>Public APIs, CLI, SDKs, and Webhooks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All components support OCPP-compliant chargers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Financial Overview (Summary)</h2>
<p>FreeFlow generates revenue via:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LCFS Credits</strong> — Recurring credits from network energy throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Credits</strong> — Internationally applicable where available.</li>
<li><strong>Driver Subscriptions</strong> — Optional service layers.</li>
<li><strong>Fleet Contracts</strong> — Larger scale operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed projection is provided separately (see Profit Model spreadsheet). This serves as a basis for contributors and partners to understand how scale leads to profit.</p>
